\chapter{On the contributions of this work}

\section{Introduction}
A detailed introduction presenting the motivation of this layout and work.
Why do we start by collaboration first? We start very high to lower and lower
level problems solving. At every level the solution proposed is open to change
adaptation and high integration capability.

\section{Reproducibility encriched collaboration}
Collaboration mode explained. Yet also the value of adding things on top of CoRR.
How the models can evolve. Backward compatibility. API implementation for applications.
Integration Examples. Toolbox on top of CoRR: Data analytics, Visualization, Interoperability
broker between Applications. Fundamental similarities between machine and computer based
records. Privacy issues and transition to the next section.

\section{Private Data and Code Discoverability}
After this point we discuss solutions on how we effectively record investigations. What we capture.

\section{Investigation Recording Toolbox}
A command line and gui tool to record experimental and computational investigations data and
metadata. corr-cmd. It is also very flexible. This toolbox has an easy to extend capability
that allows the integration of new recording approaches but also for interoperability integration.
The submited extension is tested then integrated and patched in the current release or the next one.

\section{A Unified Computational Environment Capturing Approach}
We explain a critical feature in the precedent section for computational environment and the differences
with machine ones. We address the fact that machine record requires strategies and leverage of a minimal
protocol.

\subsection{Limitations}

\section{Reproducibility focused experimental Machine Interoperability Protocol}
We try to propose a protocol that allows interoperability features but at the same time a needed design
to allow reproducibility: Machine computational state accessible programmatically. An example is a 
mechanical roller to set the temperature and a led screen display. The mechanical roll has to be infinite
to allow programmatical consistency or loopback roll to the position. The best solution is having fully
digital screens or softwares for User Interfaces to the machine to leverage the API.

\section{Numerical Caching}
We investigated here an approach of recording the investigation atomic numerics during the execution.
Which results in a heavier execution and trace. For the computation it will be the ALU sys calls and
for the machine it will be also the ALU but the position and status of all the sensors, motors and 
all electromechanical parts.

% \section{The layout of formal tables}
% This section has been modified from ``Publication quality tables in \LaTeX*''
%  by Simon Fear.

% The layout of a table has been established over centuries of experience and 
% should only be altered in extraordinary circumstances. 

% When formatting a table, remember two simple guidelines at all times:

% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Never, ever use vertical rules (lines).
%   \item Never use double rules.
% \end{enumerate}

% These guidelines may seem extreme but I have
% never found a good argument in favour of breaking them. For
% example, if you feel that the information in the left half of
% a table is so different from that on the right that it needs
% to be separated by a vertical line, then you should use two
% tables instead. Not everyone follows the second guideline:

% There are three further guidelines worth mentioning here as they
% are generally not known outside the circle of professional
% typesetters and subeditors:

% \begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{2}
%   \item Put the units in the column heading (not in the body of
%           the table).
%   \item Always precede a decimal point by a digit; thus 0.1
%       {\em not} just .1.
%   \item Do not use `ditto' signs or any other such convention to
%       repeat a previous value. In many circumstances a blank
%       will serve just as well. If it won't, then repeat the value.
% \end{enumerate}

% A frequently seen mistake is to use `\textbackslash begin\{center\}' \dots `\textbackslash end\{center\}' inside a figure or table environment. This center environment can cause additional vertical space. If you want to avoid that just use `\textbackslash centering'
